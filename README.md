# Google_data_analytics_course_cyclistic_capstone_study

## Introduction
This is a capstone study provided in the Google Data Analytics course, I will be Performing an analysis of the bikeshare company's data over a span of 12 months(2020-04 to 2021-03) to answer
the business questions required and follow the six steps of the data analysis process. This study will introduce me to the role of a job-ready junior data analyst.

## Scenario
I have been newly recruited in a marketing analyst team in a company called Cyclistic and we as a team have to understand, and analyze the data and provide the managing director a recommendation
on maximizing the annual paid memberships of the Cyclistic bikes.
We will be going through the six steps of the data analysis.

## Ask
The main objective of this analysis is to increase the annual memberships of the Cyclistic bikes and to achieve that we have to ask certain questions which are as follows:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
The insights that we gain from these questions will help us in recommending marketing strategies to our managing director Lily Moreno the business decision that would help in increasing the annual memberships.

## Prepare
The Data that we require for analysis has been made available publicly and can be downloaded from [trip_data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). This data has been claimed appropriate by Google
so the validation and credibility are verified. I have chosen the data for 12 months from 2020-04 to 2021-03, The data is named in the format YYYYMM and is listed in the trip_data. I have downloaded the data in a 
folder and stored it. The data is provided by Motivation International Inc under the [License](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). The data respects the user's privacy as it doesn't use any personal
identifiable information. The data has columns that will help me to compare users and the differences in how they use the bikes. Every single dataset contains the same column which shows us that it is organized.

## Process
The 12 datasets will be combined into one for easier manipulation, and cleaning of data. I will be choosing MySQL to analyze this project as Excel is unable to manage large amounts of data.
