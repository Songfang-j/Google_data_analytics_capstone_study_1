the business questions required and follow the six steps of the data analysis process. This study will introduce me to the role of a job-ready junior data analyst.
## Scenario
I have been newly recruited in a marketing analyst team in a company called Cyclistic and we as a team have to understand, and analyze the data and provide the managing director a recommendation
on maximizing the annual paid memberships of the Cyclistic bikes.
We will be going through the six steps of the data analysis.
## Ask
The main objective of this analysis is to increase the annual memberships of the Cyclistic bikes and to achieve that we have to ask certain questions which are as follows:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

The insights that we gain from these questions will help us in recommending marketing strategies to our managing director Lily Moreno the business decision that would help in increasing the annual memberships.

The Data that we require for analysis has been made available publicly and can be downloaded from [trip_data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)
